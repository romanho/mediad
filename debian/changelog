mediad (0.6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Use "mount.$FSTYPE" helper binaries for filesystem where such a helper is
    available (instead directly using the mount() syscall).
  * New syntax "use FSTYPE2 instead FSTYPE1" in config file, to actually use
    FSTYPE2 when libvolume-id tells use FSTYPE1 to use. This can be used, for
    example, when you want 'ntfs-fuse' instead kernel 'ntfs'.
  * New blink feature: If there is "blink-led = <LEDNAME>" in the config file,
    the named keyboard LED ("ScrollLock", "NumLock", or "CapsLock") will
    blink slowly while some directory under /media is mounted. After
    everything is unmouted, it will blink fast for a short time. This might
    help to see when a medium isn't used anymore and can be removed.
  * Updated man pages.

mediad (0.5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Suppress 'new /media/... available' message for full devices (i.e. the
    parent of partitions) when they contain no FS and child partitions exist.
  * Remove a few warnings about unused variables.

mediad (0.4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added an init script that reloads udev and explicitly starts mediad, for
    cases when udev was already started from a initrd and mediad.rules and/or
    mediad wasn't available there.

mediad (0.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix autofs kernel interface: With advent of new autofs5, the size of
    autofs_packet_union increased and the size isn't uniform across all
    packet types anymore, so a more complex handling is required.

mediad (0.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Use libvolume-id instead calling vol_id as separate process.
  * mediad.rules: many USB devices don't set the 'removable' bit, so run
    mediad unconditionally if ID_BUS is 'usb' or 'ieee1394'.
  * When replacing an existing mount, remove all aliases to avoid errors
    about existing symlinks.
  * mediad can now be called directly with the command "mediad start";
    this either says the daemon is already running, or starts it.

mediad (0.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Initial packaging.
